# Match3-skyBusiness
A match 3 game developed in unity based on codemonkey's match3 package

currently developing a match3 game, have encountered a varierty of errors while attempting to add the following mechanics:

randomize the board on start, to have randomized levels in stead of pre-designed levels - fully working.
spawn&match special gems with regular gems of the same color - fully working.
destroy all gems of one color when a special gems of that color is matched - fully working (somehow?)
bomb ability that lets the user destroy a 3x3 area on the grid based on mouse position - fully working

our main issue atm has to do with when a gem has both a vertical match & a horizontal match simultainiously, this used to work previously but doesn't anymore despite us not changing that part of the code...
